Cost per person £85. Numbers limited to 12, so book early to avoid disappointment.<p>


COURSE CONTENT.  This is a studio based two day course to practice watercolour painting, with the aim of producing a detailed and lifelike image. It will be suitable for beginners or more experienced painters. Tuition will be on an individual basis, with friendly experienced advice to help solve problems as they arise. There will be a new approach to preparatory drawing, designed to increase confidence, improve composition and take away the "fear of the white page!"<p>


THE COURSE TUTOR. Valerie Baines trained at Harrow Art School, and later became a designer for Sandersons, where she worked in the studio for five years.
She is a Founder member and past Vice-President of the Society of Botanical Artists, and a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London. Among many venues, her paintings have been exhibited in London at the Royal Academy, The Museum of Garden History, and the Royal Horticultural Society, the Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A. the Memorial University Botanical Gardens, Canada, and Yvoire,  France.  She has illustrated several books on Natural History, including "The Naturalist's Garden", "Botanical Diary", "Meadows", "Glorious Butterflies", and "Mindful of Butterflies", and has contributed to "The Art of Botanical Painting" and "The Botanical Palette". Her paintings are in collections in Britain, France, America, Canada, South Africa and Europe.<p>

SUGGESTED MATERIALS FOR THE COURSE.  The items below are useful but not obligatory, please feel free to bring any other materials that you are used to, or wish to try out.
An A3 size pad of watercolour paper, (weight 140 lb) Hot pressed (smooth surface) or NOT (slightly textured surface)  An A4 pad of tracing paper.
A propelling pencil or HB pencil, sharpener and putty rubber.
 Watercolour Paints.  Artist's colours are well worth the extra cost as they are better quality, and more translucent and long lasting.
Suggested Colours.   Winsor and Newton - Payne's Grey, Winsor Lemon, Permanent Rose and Winsor Violet are all useful for flower painting; also Scarlet Lake, Cobalt Blue, Yellow Ochre and Burnt Sienna.
 Brushes.   No's 00, 3 and 5 would be a good range. An old brush for mixing colours would be useful. W & N Cotman or Prolene are good. Dalon and Sceptre are synthetic and take a lot of wear. 
A tube of Copydex would be useful.<p>

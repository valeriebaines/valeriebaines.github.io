<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>January</b></font><p><img alt="January" src="months/january.jpg" border=0><p>As there is not much to do in your garden at present, now is the time to plan your butterfly garden. Wild flower seeds are more easily available these days either direct from the seed houses or through your local garden centre. Some catalogues give advice on wildlife gardening and sell books and wall charts on the subject.<P>&nbsp;</P>

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>February</b></font><p><img alt="February" src="months/february.jpg" border=0><p>At this time of year butterflies are still hibernating, or are hidden away in egg, caterpillar or chrysalis form. The first flowers of the year will be appearing: amongst them aconites, snowdrops, Green Hellebore, Iris unguicularis, Hamamelis mollis and Blackthorn. Notice how the Comma butterfly on the left mimics the colour and ragged edge of dead leaves, thus helping it to escape detection while it is hibenating. Things to find in the picture are hibernating Comma, Brimstone and ladybirds, and an egg of the Brown Hairstreak on the fork of a Blackthorn branch.<P>&nbsp;</P>

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>March</b></font><p><img alt="March" src="months/march.jpg" border=0><p>With longer days and the sun becoming stronger you may be lucky enough to see the first flight of the Brimstone butterfly that spent the winter hidden in the ivy and ladybirds emerging from hibernation, eager to eat greenfly. There should be more early nectar plants around, including Alkanet, Red Dead-nettle (both beloved by bees), Lesser Celandine, Primrose, Lungwort, Wood Anemones, and Sweet Violets, later to be the food plants of various fritillary butterflies. "Pussy Willow" is another sign of spring.<P>&nbsp;</P>

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>April</b></font><p><img alt="April" src="months/april.jpg" border=0><p>As more flowers appear, so the butterflies become more numerous, and you may see Orange-tips, male and female, attracted to Cuckoo Flower (also known as Ladies Smock or Milkmaid) both for nectar and as a food plant for their caterpillars. Red Campion is good value in the garden, flowering from April until November, and Bluebells and Cowslips bring in the Brimmstone. As well as brightening up our lawns the Daisy is a good source of nectar for some insects.<P>&nbsp;</P>

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>May</b></font><p><img alt="May" src="months/may.jpg" border=0><p>Here we see a group of garden flowers, Red Valerian, Apple Mint, Aubretia, Forget-me-not and Honesty, that are all attractive to butterflies as nectar plants. The Honesty may also be a caterpillar food plant for the Orange-tip. On the left is a rather ragged Small Tortoiseshell that has survived the winter to start a new generation, and at the top a Painted Lady which has migrated from somewhere that could be as far away as Africa. On the right is a Small Copper ab. cerulea punctata, a variation that has blue spots on its hind wing. The Wall butterfly is so named because it loves to bask on sunny walls.<P>&nbsp;</P>  

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>June</b></font><p><img alt="June" src="months/june.jpg" border=0><p>This painting shows a wildflower meadow in early summer, humming with activity. Flowers include Field Scaboious, Ox-eye Daisy, Harebell, Red Clover, buttercup, Ragged Robin, Hawks beard, Bird's Foot Trefoil, Horseshoe Vetch, Daisy and Scarlet Pimpernell (or Poor Man's Weather-glass, as the flowers are supposed to close before it rains). The butterflies shown here include two migrants: the Clouded Yellow and Painted Lady; the last of the previous year's generation of Brimstones, a male Orange-tip, a female Large White, two Marbled Whites, Small Coppers, a Meadow Brown, Common Blue and Adonis Blue.<P>&nbsp;</P>

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>July</b></font><p><img alt="July" src="months/july.jpg" border=0><p>July is one of the best months for the butterfly garden with so many nectar plants to tempt the butterflies to vist, including Marjoram, Goldenrod, Hemp Agrimony, Viper's Bugloss, Purple Loose Strife, Honeysuckle, Marigolds, Ox-eye Daisies, Hyssop, Sedum, Fleabane, Lavender, Corn Flowers, Thyme, Privet, Scabious, Heliotrope, Sweet William, Ragged Robin, Phlox, Alkanet and Valerian. When painting this group of flowers I noticed a small, black caterpillar eating the leaves of the Viper's Bugloss, it turned out to be (fairly predictably for 1996) a Painted Lady. It pupated in very hot weather, and emerged just over a week later as a large and perfect adult; so Viper's Bugloss can be an alterative food plant to thistle for Painted Ladies, and is more suitable for a garden.<P>&nbsp;</P>

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>August</b></font><p><img alt="August" src="months/august.jpg" border=0><p>August is the time when there are still many nectar flowers available, particularly the well known "butterfly bush", or Buddleia, (named after the Reverend Buddle). It will attract the larger and showier garden butterflies including the Red Admiral, Painted Lady, Small Tortoiseshell, Comma, and featured here, the Peacock, one of our largest and most colourful butterflies. Here we have a close look at this lovely insect. I have tried to show the furry look that newly hatched specimens have. One feels an urge to stroke them, if it were only possible!<P>&nbsp;</P>  

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>September</b></font><p><img alt="September" src="months/september.jpg" border=0><p>There are still many nectar flowers in the garden to attract butterflies, but one of the best is the Michaelmas Daisy, of which there is a great variety, and they can still be flowering well into October. All of the butterflies in this picture will hibernate over winter, an now they will be feeding to gain strength to see them through the cold, winter months. Shown here are a Red Admiral, Peacock, Small Tortoiseshell and Comma.<P>&nbsp;</P> 

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>October</b></font><p><img alt="October" src="months/october.jpg" border=0><p>The rotting windfall apples left on the ground are a great attraction to Red Admirals, who can get quite drunk on the fermented apple juice. As well as providing fruit for your own use, the flowers of blackberrys are another very good source of nectar, and will attract many different butterflies and bees, so are well worth cultivating. At this point I would like to persuade you not to cut back all the old summer herbaceous growth. If you leave it, the stems will protect the dormant plant shoots in the ground from frost and will be a hiding place for hibernating ladybirds, who will emerge early in spring eager to eat up any green-fly. The seed heads will also provide much needed food for the birds during the hard winter months. If ever you see a group (or "charm") of Goldfinches enjoying the seeds on teasels or lemon balm in winter you will never cut them back in the autumn again.

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>November</b></font><p><img alt="November" src="months/november.jpg" border=0><p>Here we see native ivy (Hedera helix) in flower with attendant Comma butterflies - so called because of the white mark on the underwing. Ivy is the last and most important source of nectar for over-wintering butterflies and bees, giving them a final feast before they search for a safe, dark corner (often in the ivy) in which to spend the winter. Because it keeps its leaves, ivy is a vital sheltering place for many insects and small birds during the winter months, and the berries which ripen in December are a staple diet for many birds.

<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc" size=5><b>December</b></font><p><img alt="December" src="months/december.jpg" border=0><p>When deciding what to paint for this month, I walked around the garden and collected these plants. In the centre is Sedum spectable, a very successful nectar plant, attracting many butterflies in late summer and autumn, but also looking decorative in winter when frosted. Honesty, with its translucent seed-heads, rerminds us that as well as being a good nectar plant in spring it is also a food plant for Orange-tips. Holly and Ivy are used by the Holly Blue in its two generations each year, and by now the berries are forming on the ivy, which will provide the birds with food during the winter. See if you can find two hibernating Brimstones, a Winter Moth and two Orange-tip chrysalids, one green and the other brown.<P>&nbsp;</P>
